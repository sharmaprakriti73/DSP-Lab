# DSP Lab (ECE-GY 6183) FINAL PROJECT 

## TUNER MASTER - Guitar Tuner

### Collaborators: Prakriti Sharma(ps4425), Rishabh Guha(rg4023)

#### Overview:

In this project, we have created an interactive guitar tuner called the ‘Tuner Master’. We have taken inspiration for this idea from a music educational app called Yousician. As a guitar player, it was a very fascinating idea to create our own tuner that could be used to tune my guitar. The application takes input from the microphone in real-time and determines the frequency of the input sound to identify which musical note it sounds the closest to.  The UI changes dynamically to indicate the frequency difference between the input and the closest true note. This way, it will align the measured frequencies with the note names in scale. If the frequencies match a particular note, the tuner will display the names of that note on the screen.


#### Steps to run the TUNER MASTER using python:

1. We need to install all the required libraries before running the application. Run:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the main python file (main.py) using:

python3 main.py

Running the steps stated above will run the application and you can get started with tuning your guitar from here!
